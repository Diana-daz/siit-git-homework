    <h1> Git and its sapience</h1>
    <p> Git Git is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, 
        and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code 
        files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. 
        GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly 
        network, collaborate, and pitch their work.</p>
        When a developer wants to make a change to a piece of software, they:
        <ol>

<li>Download their copy of the source code from its central storage location (called a repository) to their local system </li>
<li>modifications safely to their copy</li>
<li>Merge their revised copy back with the source files in the repository </li>
<li>Add comments explaining the changes </li>
